- Cut most special Pagan CBs. Pagans can launch county conquests on a five-year cooldown timer but regular Pagan warfare will mostly be about raiding.
- Reformed Pagans can no longer loot, travel on rivers or prepare invasions (making them behave more like other organized religions and making it so reforming is not just a straight upgrade).

- If a faction overthrows a child ruler or a ruler with a child heir, that ruler's primary titles will now be distributed among the rebels according to claims and de-jure claims.
- Expanded greatly on the faction system. Instead of being arbitrarily ruled over by their leaders, factions will now hold meetings where the faction leader can set an agenda and propose actions that members vote on. Faction leaders who are self-serving or fail to get their agenda through may be thrown out and replaced by a new leader (decided by order of joining the faction). All in all, this new system should make it much more fun to play as a vassal and give the player a reason to join a faction.
- Can now only sow dissent towards characters who have the same religion.
- Hamburg now starts as a duke-tier merchant republic.
- The Hansa event is now a dynamic event that fires if any duke-tier merchant republic in the HRE controlling either Lübeck, Hamburg or Bremen grows to a realm size of 10. The title can also be created by independent merchant republics holding Lübeck.

- If a faction depose revolt would result in a child or a character of a different dynasty succeeding, the throne will instead be taken by the revolt leader.
- Retired the various No X modules and added a new 'Hardcore Mode' module. Default CK2+ now has higher income, higher demesne sizes and faster claims fabrication. Hardcore mode lowers your income, slows expansion and gives you a smaller demesne and unhappier factions among other effects. It is meant to appeal to players who want slower expansion and a more challenging game. This change replaces the default difficulty setting, which no longer has an effect.

1.33.15:
- Toned down peasant rebellions.

1.33.12:
- Fixed some bad triggers in leadership trait battle events.
- Restored vanilla rebel system because of some issues with the recent patch and Better Rebels. Revolt risk effects were reduced across the board and the large size of rebel armies kept, so revolts should be rare but potentially dangerous.

- Fixed several minor bugs with the new demesne laws.
- If Jerusalem is held by a Catholic ruler, the Knights Templar and Knights of St. John will now become vassals of the King of Jerusalem.
- Restored events for Knights Templar and Knights of St. John to build castles.
- Player and player's vassals should now never be affected by automatic transfer of baronies to province owner.
- Vassals of an entire different religion or culture group will no longer join the regular factions. Instead, they will tend to form Separatist factions or back Pretenders of their own culture and religion. They may still join in a revolt that benefits them on an individual basis.

- Increased base demesne cap of counts and dukes.
- Disabled patricians joining factions as this is currently rife with issues.
- Hansa will now tend to form earlier than actual history, to give Gotland some real competition.
- Mercenary bands will now grow in strength over time.
- Ancona is now an independent Serene Republic in the earliest start dates.

1.33.3:
- Fixed a bug where a non-patrician vassal would endlessly request the transfer of a patrician to be their vassal.
- Increased the importance of trade zone value in determining the profitability of a trade post.

- Ancona is now a proper merchant republic in the earliest start dates.
- Restored regular mercenary system for AI.
- The Papacy is once again a King level title.
- Republican rulers can now only use the coastal republic CB for ports where they control a trade post, and doing so will anger every ruler in whose lands they control trade posts.
- Nerfed income of Merchant Republics and cut the Acquire Trade Post plot.
- Can now only seize trade posts from families in the same Republic with an equal number or more trade posts than yourself.
- AI will now factor in relations and traits more heavily when determining whether to launch an embargo war against a republic.

1.32.35:

- The Latin Empire and Byzantium will now always be destroyed if Constantinople is lost to them, regardless of realm size.
- Added a 'Byzantine Restoration' CB against the holder of Constantinople for independent Orthodox Byzantine culture group rulers if Byzantium does not exist. A successful war will result in taking the Duchy of Thrace and recreating the Byzantine Empire.
- Increased prestige impact of marriages to planned 1.09 levels.
- AI now less inclined to wage excommunication wars unless they are Zealous, have high piety or really dislike the target.
- Issuing a repentance of sins is no longer guaranteed to lift your excommunication, the Pope may say no depending on opinion and traits. If the Pope says no you must wait five years to try again.

- The Golden Horde and Il-Khanate can now end up disbanding their Empires if they fall below 100 holdings after converting to another faith.
- The Golden Horde and Il-Khanate will no longer convert to another faith until they reach at least 100 holdings in size.

- The AI will now change gender succession laws when appropriate.
- Vassal opinion from raised levies will now drop faster, to correspond with the faster pace of wars in CK2+.
- Reworked the way succession law changes work to prevent any unintentional loss of prestige or opinion impacts when creating titles. This is purely a backend change and players should not notice anything being different.
- Updated to the latest version of Culturally Different Cities.
- Vassals who choose to keep the lands gained in a Crusade will now relinquish all their old titles to their liege.
- Choosing to keep the lands gained in a Crusade for yourself will now give you the relevant titles and holy truce modifier, just as if you gave it to a relative.

- A ruler with Lifetime Appointments can now dismiss the Court Chaplain if said Court Chaplain is a different religion.
- Added a workaround for a vanilla problem that was breaking the Lifetime Appointments law.
- Vassals will no longer demand changes in Tax/Levy Privileges if their liege does not qualify for those laws (they are only available to Kings and up).

1.32.32:

- Fixed a bug where changing succession laws while holding multiple primary titles would result in extreme relation drops.
- Added new titles for all levels/types of Jewish rulers, created by Necroskowitz.
- Added the 'Council Terms' demesne law group. This law allows you to set councillor appointments to last for life, which will make the Court Faction happy.
- Added the 'Levy Privileges' demesne law group. This law allows you to grant your vassals the right to decide how many troops they will raise for you (based on opinion) or force them to raise up to the maximum required by law.
- Added the 'Tax Privileges' demesne law group. This law allows you to grant your vassals the right to raise additional taxes at the expense of your own revenues, grant yourself the right to raise additional taxes at the expense of your vassals, or set tax levels at the same for both vassals and liege.
- Removed the vassal opinion penalties for demesne laws and replaced them with faction mood bonuses/maluses, so Crown Tax Privileges and High Feudal Taxes will anger the Princely faction, for example.
- Reworked demesne taxation laws. They are now simplified down to 3 steps, each step representing 20% taxation of cities/temples or 10% taxation on feudal vassals.
- Removed demesne levy laws.
- Changed default CA to Autonomous because of a vanilla bug where default CA law set anywhere other than Autonomous would cause a CA reset on religious conversion.

- All CBs should now work properly with the Win a War ambition.

1.32.31:
- Maimed characters are now more suspectible to illness.
- Non-cultural retinues now have small offensive and defensive bonuses to both their unit types, to make them more competetive with cultural retinues.
- Gender Equality no longer sets Muslim titles to Cognatic, as lack of matrilineal marriages makes them unplayable.
- The Ecumenical Patriarch is now properly the Orthodox head of religion in Greece and Anatolia.

1.32.30:
- Fixed a bug where a faction war to depose would lower CA two steps instead of one.
- Fixed a bug that was causing vassals that broke away in an independence war to be immediately revassalized.

1.32.29:
- If a ruler is toppled in a pretender revolt, any non-dejure vassals they control will now automatically be transfered to the pretender.

- Added two new optional modules, 'No De Jure Drift' which turns off de jure drift and 'No Drift & No Assaults' which turns off both de jure drift and assaults. You should only use one of the 'No X' modules at any given time.
- A failed murder or kidnapping attempt that aborts the plot will now make that character immune to the same kind of plot for five years.
- Ruler designer Immortal trait should now work correctly.

1.32.25:
- If a child ruler is deposed in a faction revolt, the faction leader will now assume the throne.
- Vassal rulers can now only get random claims inside their realm.
- You will now be notified when another ruler receives a random claim to one of your titles.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing Separatist factions from forming.

- More fixes and tweaks to the faction system.
- Female characters are now treated equally for the purposes of pressing claims and succession wars under the Gender Equality module.
- You will no longer be expected to reward supporters in minor civil wars (such as a single vassal revolting).

1.32.24:
- Fixed a very bad bug where a successful excommunication war would result in the attacking ruler abdicating.
- Separatist sentiment now spreads faster in areas distant from the capital, so that large blobs are more prone to collapse.

1.32.23:
- Added a workaround that should revassalize vassals who become independent as a result of a rebellion becoming invalid within a month or so of the war being invalidated.
- Fixed a number of minor bugs detected by validator.
- Restored the fix for immortal trait not working from character designer, since the Paradox fix apparently didn't take.
- Rulers can now once again 'go native' as a result of living in a province with a culture not too different from their own (German characters are likely to become Dutch, but aren't going to become Turkish, for example). This should greatly cut down on minority cultures being wiped out over the progress of the game.
- Non-contingent territories (exclaves and islands) will now be much more inclined towards separatism (culture and religion still factor in majorly, though).
- The AI will now prioritize forming contingent territories when waging holy war.
- Increased the prestige cost for unjustified revocation of titles.
- Characters who are revolting against their liege due to a title revocation or imprisonment will now attempt to call in the rest of the realm.
- Characters who are not a member of a faction will now get called into revolts, although they are unlikely to pick sides unless they either strongly like or dislike their liege.

1.32.22:
- Added an experimental possible fix for the 'characers dying on abdication' bug.
- Fixed some more bugs with starting before 1066.
- The AI is now much more keen to switch out of Gavelkind in Shattered World and Reign of Princes.

1.32.21:
- Fixed a bug that was making close relatives in your court marry without your permission.
- Fixed a bug where an AI-only decision was accidentally available to players.
- Using a start date before 1066 will no longer break the mod.

1.32.20:
- Fixed a bug where AI mercenaries would not get disbanded after war because they had lost their regimental earmark.

1.32.19:
- Fixed minor bugs and mistakes with Shattered World and Reign of Princes.
- Separatist revolts will no longer call in the other factions to the war.
- The AI will no longer blind prisoners unless it is in the Byzantine culture group. The option is still available to players.

1.32.18:
- Pagans now use Muslim CoA shapes, though with non-Muslim CoAs, to make them visually distinct from both Christians and Muslims on the map.
- Added a new 'Reign of Princes' scenario to the Alternative Scenarios module. This scenario builds on Shattered World, dividing the world into mostly Duchy-sized independent states, with a smattering of Theocracies, Republics and (mostly titular) Kingdoms. It adds a number of new titles that are only available within this scenario.
- The first generation of rulers in Shattered World will now get a special trait that greatly encourages the AI to expand heedless of risk.

1.32.17:
- The decision to blind prisoners is now available to everyone, though the AI will rarely use it unless in the Byzantine culture group.
- The decision to castrate prisoners is now also available to Muslims.
- Kiev no longer starts as a Kingdom in 1066, but is set to have existed in the previous generation to prevent the Russian Dukes from having claims on each other.
- Increased the de jure land of Kiev to prevent it from being immediately reformed.
- Further increased likelyhood of Separatist movements forming.
- A rebellious faction that does not take another action should now declare war to depose their liege within a few years of becoming rebellious.
- Reduced the average size of the Mongol starting stacks (they can still start with very large armies, its just less likely).
- Fixed a bug causing other factions not being called into faction wars to depose.
- Faction revolts should now occur a bit faster.

1.32.16:
- Fixed a bug that was breaking Lower Crown Authority civil wars.

1.32.15:
- Tweaked the faction relations formula to work better in large realms.
- Changed the way faction moods work. Instead of trending upwards or downwards over time, the mood will be set each maintenance pulse depending on the relevant factors such as relations and faction goals, meaning that factions will be much quicker to respond to changes in the realm. Effects that give faction mood from events and decisions will add a temporary mood modifier that 'bleeds off' over time.
- Increased the chance of separatist factions forming (it was set at far too low).
- Fixed some bugs with the negative consequenses event for trying to sow dissent.

1.32.14:
- Various fixes and tweaks to the faction system.
- Fixed a bug where a faction leader declaring to lower CA would not bring his faction with him.
- Pretender revolts will now attempt to call in the other factions when declaring war.
- Separatist movements are now more likely to form in general.
- Tweaked faction moods to be less stable.
- Using the Gender Equality module should no longer result in your ruler being hated by their vassals on game startup.
- Catholic AI will now avoid expansion into Tengri lands until the Mongols arrive.
- A faction who ends up with their liege as a member due to the liege remaining in faction on inheritance bug will now disband and reform to correct the problem.
- Increased the impact of tactics to add unpredicability to battles and make it less of a numbers game.

1.32.13:
- Added new graphical icons to the faction mood modifiers, to make them more immediately obvious.
- New french translation courtesy of Faelron.
- Fixed a bug where playing with the Gender Equality module would result in prestige loss on starting up the game.

1.32.12:
- Fixed a bug that was preventing separatist movements from forming.
- Relatives who are denied estates should no longer be able to retake the ambition and ask again.
- Women can now properly be granted titles under Gender Equality. However, you will be unable to change your succession laws for the first ruler you play with using the module. There is no way around this that I know of.
- Fixed a bug where the wrong country would get the Aztec army spawned for them.
- You are no longer allowed to fabricate evidence of heresy against your vassals (as this allowed for exploits with the free imprisonment/ransom).

1.32.11:
- Fixed a bug that was preventing claimant factions from gaining support.

1.32.10:
- Vassals in small realms will now tend to consolidate into fewer factions so they can better match their liege in strength.
- The Princely, Religious and Court factions can now declare war to overthrow their liege if angered.
- Separatist sentiment will now spread more evenly in the realm as a result of angry factions. This should result in more sensible independence revolts.
- Fixed a bug where an AI vassal would try to join multiple factions simultaneously.
- Tweaked AI faction picking priorities.
- Fixed a bug where a vassal inheriting their liege's title would result in them in them remaining in their old (lower level) faction.
- Claimants should now have an easier time gaining backing from unhappy factions.
- Reduced the size of Harold Godwinsson's starting army (some wonky math made it far too large).
- Separatist movements should now take more time to build strength before declaring war.

1.32.9:
- Fixed another major broken scope issue.

1.32.8:
- The Immortal trait is once again available in the ruler designer (it was accidentally taken out).
- Fixed a major issue with bad scopes in factions introduced in 1.32.7.

1.32.7:
- Fixed some more problems with the Aztec invasion events.
- Dukes will no longer have a Princely faction as they are unable to meet most of their demands. They still have the Court, Republican and Religious factions.
- Fixed a bug where a vassal revolting against a liege that was not independent would cause some issues with the factions of their liege's liege.
- After a successful independence war, both sides will now greatly dislike each other to prevent re-vassalization.

1.32.5:
- Councillor job events should now fire properly for female councillors with the Gender Equality module.
- Fixed some minor bugs with faction mood notification events.
- Increased the likelyhood of separatist movements forming.
- Fixed a bug where factions would declare war to reduce CA in a realm that was already at autonomous vassals.

1.32.4:
- Fixed a bug that was breaking the Aztec invasion. For the fix to work correctly you will need to play a new game or use a save from before the Aztecs invade.
- The Princely Faction 'more levies' event should now work correctly.

1.32.3:
- Reduced the frequency of random claims.
- Increased the speed at which faction moods change and lowered the MTTH of many faction related events.
- Fixed a bug that caused some randomly created characters to get the immortal trait.

1.32.2:
- Fixed a bug where the 'end of tournament' event would fire repeatedly and endlessly.

1.32.1:
- You will now get a severe penalty to general opinion and prestige for being a member of multiple 'main' factions (so you can be a member of the Princely Faction and a Separatist, but you get a penalty if you're in both the Princely and Court factions).
- Fixed a duplicate succession law issue in the Gender Equality module.
- The Count of Napoli no longer starts as a duke in Shattered World.
- A successful independence war will no longer result in the defeated liege gaining claims on the revolters.

1.32:
- Now compatible with 1.08 and Sunset Invasion.
- Completely reworked the faction system. There are now four more-or-less permanent factions, each serving the interests of a particular group in your realm. For example, the Princely Faction looks after the interests of the high aristocracy, and want low CA and a weak liege, while the Religious Faction wants holy wars and a pious liege. Factions have moods ranging from Happy to Angry, and will help or hinder their liege depending on their mood. An unhappy or angry faction might demand changes in the crown laws, back a pretender, or even start an independence movement if relations deteriorate far enough. To keep the factions happy, you will need to look after their goals and maintain good relations with the members - relations with faction leaders are especially important. For more information on a specific faction's goals, mouseover the faction's name in the faction screen. To see a faction's mood, look at the character modifiers of its leader.
- The 'Sow Dissent' chancellor action now works by reducing the relations between the targeted province's owner and all their count and above level vassals. This should make it much simpler and more useful in general.
- It is now possible (but rare) for non martially educated characters to pick up leader traits in battle.
- Increased the prestige cost for attacking an ally.
- You now need 200 realm holdings to form an empire, up from 100.
- Titular empires that drop below 100 holdings will now disband, up from 75.
- Removed the 'No Time Limit' optional module. No Time Limit is now on by default.
- Added a new 'Gender Equality' optional module. This module allows women to serve on any position in the council and sets all titles to Cognatic succession.
- Independent female rulers can now lead armies. The AI will avoid doing so unless their martial score is high.
- By default, the Aztec invasion will now happen roughly 1 out of 10 games. You can use the 'Vanilla Aztecs' optional module to make them appear every game. They will only ever appear if you have Sunset Invasion installed and activated.
- Added a decision to summon your children to your court, if they are currently the subjects of a different, lower-ranked court.
- Changed back to vanilla education after running several tests that showed that skills and stats decline over time because of the AI's inability to understand the CK2+ education system.
- Added a character decision to pardon characters who you have rightful imprisonment against as a result of plotting, murder of treason. This will remove any such rightful imprisonment causes and increase their opinion of you.
- You can now execute characters who are caught plotting, murdering or kidnapping without getting tyranny.
- The mod will now load instantly on game startup, thanks to the magic of the character history effect scope.
- Added a generic decision to give money to charity in exchange for piety for characters that don't have access to indulgences or Sadaqah.
- Removed the Duchy Conquest CB, as the original reason for it (Muslim realm collapse) is long since gone. Instead, fabricating claims is now easier, especially in Shattered World.
- Tweaked the Fourth Crusade scenario. Byzantium now ceases to exist on the Latin Empire start date, and is instead replaced by the Despotate of Nicaea, who start with a claim to the Latin Empire.
- Any Orthodox character who takes over the Latin Empire will now immediately gain Byzantium (and lose the Latin Empire) if Byzantium does not already have a holder. If Byzantium has a holder, the Latin Empire will simply be destroyed.
- Byzantium should no longer be immediately destroyed due to small size in the late scenarios.
- The Ottomans are no longer an Empire level title.
- The AI will no longer carry out plots that they have no ability to succeed with, such as fabricating claims.
- Plots should now properly show up in the intrigue screen when conditions are right.
- You are no longer allowed to kidnap rulers unless they are a vassal of yours, to prevent some exploits with it and wars.

1.13.14:
- Fixed another bug where characters could end up with random claims on distant titles.

1.31.13:
- Fixed a bug where plots would not complete properly.

1.31.12:
- Fixed a bug where characters could end up with random claims on distant titles.
- Fixed some minor localisation errors.

1.31.11:
- Fixed a bug where you would be unable to complete the same plot twice with the same character due to bad flag cleanup.
- Fixed a bug where plots would abort incorrectly or count as having succeeded despite failing them due to bad flags.
- It is no longer possible to declare war while hosting a grand tournament, to prevent the AI from aborting its own tournaments.
- Tweaked the 'Fabricate Evidence of Treason' plot events to make more sense when targeting your own vassal.
- Children and young characters will now get traits to reflect their age. Young characters get a reduction to their stats and the respect of their vassals due to inexperience, but a bonus to health, fertility and sex appeal.
- The AI should now be significantly more aggressive, especially in the Shattered World scenario.
- Fixed a bug where the random claim event could give you a claim on a Duchy without a holder.
- The Restore the Papacy CB is no longer available in the Shattered World scenario.

1.31.10:
- All provinces in Shattered World should now have a playable count. There may be a handful of Lowborn characters still holding counties who are not playable - please report them as you find them.
- The AI should now get considerably more random claims in Shattered World.
- Fixed some minor database bugs.

1.31.9:
- Fixed a bug that was causing some rebellion wars as a result of imprisonment to end inconclusively.

1.31.8:
- Fixed misaligned CoAs.

1.31.7:
- Fixed a save game incompatability issue.
- Fixed a bug where the Duchy Conquest CB would be available to Christians outside of the Shattered World scenario.

1.31.6:
- Fixed numerous database issues in the hopes of addressing crashes in 1.31.5.
- Fixed a bug where a Crusade ending in White Peace would lead to a MA boost for the attacker.
- Integrated the new faction-related events tied to the 'Scheme' spymaster job.
- Fixed a bug where commanders could pick up an unlimited number of combat traits.
- All religions can now use Duchy Conquest in the Shattered World scenario.

1.31.5:
- Fixed some history file bugs.
- Fixed the numbering in the .mod file.

1.31.4:
- Updated for 1.07b.
- The amount of money taken in embezzlement is now scaled to rank (50 for count, 75 for duke, 100 for king/emperor)
- Fixed a bug that would cause repeated crusades against Byzantium after a failed 'Fourth Crusade' scenario.

1.31.3:
- Reduced the frequency of AI plots.
- Plots will now generally fire a bit faster, to make it harder to detect and quash every single plot.
- Fixed some bugs with the Get Married ambition.
- Eunuchs should no longer be able to take lovers or procreate.
- Increased the amount of money taken in an embezzle plot, as well as the chances of success.
- Tweaked factions to be slower to form, but faster to get membership under favorable circumstances.
- Fixed a bug where characters would get imprisoned in wars they were not a participant in.
- Fixed further bugs with CBs and ambitions.

1.31.2:
- Fixed some further bugs with CBs.
- Integrated honorary title changes from 1.07.
- All commander traits are now available in the character designer.
- Tweaked the extra units given in civil wars to work better with CK2+'s levy calculations.

1.31.1:
- Fixed some issues with broken/buggy CBs.
- Integrated some missed values in technologies.txt
- Fixed a bug where the pentarchies were not working correctly.
- Fixed some problems with religions being assigned the wrong icons.

1.31:
- Updated to 1.07 and Legacy of Rome.
- The mod should now be much faster to start up once the game gets going (less lag).
- It is no longer possible to start a faction or declare war until the mod has started up (should occur within a week of starting date).
- Removed the Imperial Reconquest CB.
- There is no longer a difference between a realm's offensive and defensive levies (as this plays havoc with LoR's power calculation systems). The base levies for large decentralized realms were increased somewhat.
- Retired several mechanics made redundant by LoR, such as the regency trait, the civil war system and the genetics system. Future versions will work on expanding the faction system, incorporating some of the ideas from the cut civil war system.
- Retired the BLC module, as it was incompatible with the many character graphics changes in 1.07.

1.30.3:
- It is now possible to imprison characters in war as a result of taking control of the holdings where they are located.
- Fixed a 'gap' in the new levies system where realms of a particular size (~90 holdings) would get almost no levies.
- It is now possible to legitimize bastards of your dynasty as long as you are their direct liege, even if they are not your child.
- Added the Kingdoms of Northumbria and Wessex as Anglo-Saxon alternatives to Mercia (not createable if you are already a King).

1.30.1:
- Fixed a bug that was breaking Holy Wars unless you had very high piety.

1.30:
- Fixed a bug where a revolt that did not trigger a civil war could cause weird out-of-realm usurpations if successful.
- Fixed a bug where titular Elective titles would be unable to change succession laws properly.
- Vassals who are married to their liege's sibling, child or parent will now get an opinion bonus towards their liege, so that you can use marriage alliances to make your vassals more loyal.
- Creating the Israel title will now activate and vassalize a Jewish holy order.
- Increased the tax bonus for very small (1 or 2 county) demesnes.
- You can now declare war to force-vassalize an indepedent ruler whose titles are all de jure vassals of yourself or one of your vassals. Medium or higher CA is required to subjugate de jure vassals of a King or Empire title.
- Reworked the levy system. The amount of levies you can raise from your vassals is now based on three factors: Realm size (total number of holdings in your realm), crown authority and whether or not you are fighting a defensive/civil war. The smaller your realm, the more base troops you will be able to call on, and the less important crown authority becomes, while a very large realm with autonomous vassals (for example the HRE) will be very weak on the offensive. Together with the small demesne tax bonus, this is meant to make having a small demesne / lots of counts as a vassal or a small realm a viable strategy.
- Added the province of Sinkat in Abyssinia.
- Totally reworked duchy/county colors to give them their own distinct coloration instead of 'regional' colors, to make independent states and politically divided areas stand out more and make the direct vassal / duchy de jure mapmodes easier to interpret.
- Turned off the my documents user directory once again as it was causing loadup crashes for some users.
- Holy Wars and Duchy Conquests will now once again usurp the Duchy title, if it is held by either the target or one of their vassals.

1.29.2:
- Fixed a problem with the Mongols that was making their scripted armies vanish.
- Rebels will no longer declare independence immediately upon taking control of a province, but rather after several months of uncontested control of it.
- Fixed a bug that was causing the new plot icons not to appear.

1.29.1:
- Fixed a bug that was breaking many of the new plots.

1.29:
- CK2+ now has its own user folder in My Documents (since they seem to work without nuking your message settings now).
- The Kingdoms of Saxony, Bavaria and Frisia are now de jure HRE.
- You can no longer create, usurp, or be granted Duchy and above level titles during war, to prevent various bugs and AI problems.
- Merged the Kingdom of Muscowy into Novgorod and Kiev.
- Added the de jure Duchy of Latium.
- Merged Ancona and Spoleto into Spoleto.
- Added the titular duchy-tier Republics of Bologna, San Marino and Ancona.
- Increased prestige requirements for raising crown authority.
- You now need high CA to freely revoke infidels.
- An independent player bordering the Il-Khanate or Golden Horde will now be given the chance to swear fealty and pay tribute to the Mongols rather than being invaded. This option only occurs once, and only before the Horde in question settles (converts religion).
- Fixed a bug that caused persistent crashes when starting a game after 1244.
- Significantly tweaked the de jure borders of Byzantium and surrounding territories. Wallachia, Epirus and Trebizond are now de jure Kingdoms, while Thessalonica is a titular Kingdom only createable by Catholics, similar to Cyprus.
- Characters with a small demesne (less than 4 holdings) will now get a tax bonus (50% at 1 demesne, 25% at 2 and 10% at 3), to encourage the creation of more counts and make single-province counts more fun to play.
- Loyalists and Rebels in a civil war are now distinguished by the 'Loyalist' and 'Rebel' traits, which will be properly transfered to their heir if they die during the civil war.
- AI vassals may now attempt a bid for independence if the realm is already in a civil war they are not a part of.
- You can now press Kingdom De Jure claims on behalf of vassals (as long as their Kingdom has Medium or higher CA).
- You can now declare De Jure claims for Duchies that you either control all the counties in, or whose (Medium or higher CA) King or Empire title you hold.
- Added six new plots: Discredit Councillor, Embezzle from Liege, Instigate Revolt, Kidnap Character, Fabricate Claims of Treason and Accuse of Heresy.
- Added some additional checks that should hopefully prevent cultural melting pots from spreading where they shouldn't.
- Added a workaround for characters with estates not getting income. They will now get a yearly sum of money equal to their estates income.
- Fixed a bug where a character who had murdered another character through plot would be unable to ever do so again because of a flag that did not clear.
- Fixed a bug where a vassal demanding a title to stay loyal would revolt even if given the title.
- Fixed a bug where revolters would almost never declare independence at the end of a civil war because of some logic problems.
- Rebel titles will no longer make use of the dynastic title naming system.
- Fixed a bug where a marshal's ability to suppress revolts was inversely proportional to his skill.
- Cleaned up the landed CoA folder, getting rid of many off-center flags and reducing the overall size of the mod considerably.
- Shifted de jure borders of Abyssinia to prevent some undesirable usurpations.
- Fixed a bug where a pagan ruler converting through the missionary events would not also convert their children.
- Fixed an exploit where a player supporter of the rebel side in a civil war could avoid punishment by switching lieges mid-war. Even if you do switch lieges, you will now still be imprisoned with a revoke reason upon the defeat of the rebels.
- The defending side in a civil war will now get more prestige for winning than they would for defeating a regular revolt.
- Increased decadence gain from random events.
- Fixed a bug that caused the rebel leader in a civil to sometimes get a big prestige hit.
- It is now easier for vassals to rally support for a civil war in a large realm.
- Opinion of liege now matters more when determining whether to join the rebel side in a civil war, and opinion of rebel leader a bit less.
- Added some AI tweaks that should hopefully make the AI more willing to take on foes their own size.
- Crusades/Jihads are now called by the liege of the head of religion, if the head of religion is a vassal (the head of religion's piety is still used in determening when a Jihad can be called).
- Reduced base income from temple and city holdings.
- Decreased impact of tax levels on opinion for city and temple vassals.
- Burgundy is now a de jure part of the HRE.
- Waging Duchy Conquests on other Muslims will now increase decadence.
- Only independent Muslims and Pagans are now allowed to wage Duchy Conquests.
- Vassals who are engaged in their own wars can no longer pick sides in a civil war, to prevent some issues related to vassals in a civil war joining in a higher level civil war.
- Enabled Ethiopian and Nubian mercenaries for all non-Muslim faiths (so Semien can hire mercs).

1.28.4:
- Fixed a major bug where any character in the game could get events for possessed characters.
- Rulers who are part of the rebel side in a civil war can no longer declare their own wars until the civil war is resolved.

1.28.3:
- Fixed a major bug with civil wars that was causing vassals who pledged their support to the rebels early on not to join the war.

1.28.2:
- Fixed a bug that was massively inflating AI loan sizes on higher difficulties.
- The AI will now take loans to create King titles, to encourage their more frequent creation.
- Fixed a bug where you would be unable to declare a sanctioned holy war unless you had enough piety for an unsanctione one.
- Fixed several minor bugs with civil wars.
- Eased up on AI requirements to switch out of Seniority since it is a difficulty enough law to switch out of even for a player.
- Added decisions to convert to your capital's culture and religion (for players only).
- De Jure Emperors will now lose their Emperor title if their realm size drops below 50 (compared to 75 for titular Emperors).

1.28.1:
- Fixed various bugs with civil wars where defeated rebels would not be properly imprisoned or end up as a vassal of the wrong liege.
- Fixed a bug where vassals who declared independence after a civil war would incorrectly be given tax privileges.

1.28:
- Reduced frequency of second wives asking to be first wife.
- Reduced the alarming frequency of Muslim wives stabbing each other to death (I don't think life in the harem was quite this violent historically).
- Fixed a bug that was making the Mongol scripted armies disappear prematurely.
- Implemented a brand new civil war system. When a vassal revolts against their liege, he or she will now attempt to rally support for a civil war among the other vassals. If at least 33% of the liege's other vassals (measured in controlled provinces) support the rebellion, then a civil war begins. In a civil war, the leading rebel (original attacker) takes on a special rebel title of equivalent rank to his or her liege, and vassalizes all other rebels, allowing the revolters to fight as a unified realm. Vassals in the civil war who do not side with the rebels can either support their liege (allowing him or her to draw more troops from them), stay neutral, or demand titles they have de jure claims on in exchange for their support. Civil wars break down into two categories: Wars to depose (depose liege, war against tyranny and revolt against rule) and succession wars against liege. In a successful civil war to depose, the liege will be overthrown and most of his or her titles divided among the rebels according to de jure pretensions. In a successful succession civil war, the pretender will take all primary (or King and above) level titles from the old liege. Either way, a successful civil war also allows non-dejure vassals and vassals under very low crown authority to break away and declare independence. Finally, at the end of a civil war, regardless of which side won, the winner(s) will be expected to reward their supporters at the expense of themselves and the neutrals and losers, and all vassals supporting the losing side will be imprisoned by the winning side with valid reasons to revoke - so be careful about picking sides!
- If a player dies with tyranny, their heir will now inherit all but 10 levels of said tyranny (so if the dead character had 20 tyranny, his heir will get 10 on taking the throne).
- Reduced the duration of the bubonic plague, as some players were reporting apocalyptic-level outbreaks.
- Increased salaries from offices and honorary titles. A single-province count that is councillor to an emperor will now almost double his income (note that office incomes still won't show up in your budget screen - this is a vanilla bug).
- You must now have the piety on hand to wage an Unsanctioned Holy War or Duchy Conquest (100/250 and 200/500 respectively).
- Moved African Pagans into their own religion group.
- Changed Abyssinia's territories to more closely match the actual Zagwe territories in 1066.
- Added the Kingdom of Semien (Beta Israel), a Jewish Kingdom controlling the Gondar region in 1066. 
- It is now possible to revoke titles at autonomous vassals. I tried to find a way to make it possible only for vassals revoking their own vassals, but this is not doable and being unable to revoke makes autonomous vassals extremely undesirable even if you are a vassal which is just plain odd.
- Creating a Kingdom or Empire now costs a little bit of piety (to make the creation requirements less confusing).
- Orthodox AI is now much more reluctant to wage holy wars, to reduce ahistorical Russian blobbing into Finland and Byzantine blobbing into Romania.
- Pressing De Jure claims on a Holy Order of your religion now costs 500 piety.
- The AI will now avoid pressing De Jure claims on Holy Orders of their own religion.
- Integrated the ARKO pack and Patrum Scuta mods, both of which greatly improve both the regular and dynastic CoAs.
- Characters who are imprisoned by their liege will now have their honorary title revoked.
- Landless characters can now hold estates that give them small amounts of revenue and prestige, represented through character modifiers. Estates range from minor (1) to large (5) with each level giving more income and prestige. You can grant estates to characters at the cost of 50 gold per 'level'. Additionally, courtiers with money and no prospect to inherit titles will spend their own money to purchase estates. On a character's death, their estates are divided among their sons. Characters who gain a landed title will sell off their estates, and banished characters lose all their estates. Characters who are granted estates will like you more, and landless relatives are less likely to ask for or plot to get a landed title if they have been given estates. Characters with estates are given the special title 'Lord'.
- Added an objective for landless characters to get estates or increase the size existing estates.
- Reduced the base chance of the AI joining revolts since they are now more dangerous due to AI use of mercenaries.
- The AI should no longer be able to spawn mercenaries outside of its own realm.
- Tweaked genetics code to reduce the frequency of Genius, Quick, Slow and Imbecile.
- Rulers are no longer able to seduce themselves with the lover event chain.

1.27.1:
- Fixed a major bug that was preventing the AI from using Holy War and Duchy Conquest correctly.
- Tweaked independence wars to make De Jure status more important in determining whether vassals will seek independence.
- Tweaked civil wars so that when a liege's titles are divided among his vasals, another civil war should not immediately occur as he tries to take them back.

1.27:
- The AI now uses its own system for hiring mercenaries, and will make liberal use of them at the start of wars it cannot be sure to win, instead of hiring them after its armies have already been destroyed. The AI pays reduced maintenance for these mercenaries (because it does not use the regular mercenary system) but double the hiring cost to balance it out.
- Landless relatives are now more likely to plot against you if you are Muslim.
- Reworked decadence. It is now almost purely event-driven, with landed/unlanded relatives having no effect. Additionally, dynasty members who are vassals of other members of their dynasty will have no effect on decadence at all - good or bad. Bad traits and long periods of peace will increase decadence, while religious observance, good traits and participating in combat will decrease it. The overall effects of decadence on tax and morale were also reduced, to make it less of a factor. 
- A titular Emperor whose realm drops below 75 holdings in size will now lose all their titular empire titles. Certain titles such as the Papacy, Mongol titles and the Latin Empire are exempt from this, as are Emperors who are in the midst of civil war (as this can temporarily reduce realm size).
- Difficulty setting now heavily affects the player's chance of discovering plots and the chance of vassals joining a revolt against them, for players who want more or less challenge from their vassals.
- Changed the requirements for creating an empire. Instead of requiring a set number of provinces, empires now require a certain Realm Size (number of holdings in realm, shown next to your demesne limit and score). Most empires require a Realm Size of 100 to create.
- Independence wars now work much like other revolts, with a ruler fighting an independence war calling in all other vassals to their war and all revolters becoming independent if the war succeeds. Non-De Jure vassals or vassals not of their liege's culture/religion are more likely to join an independence revolt, and De Jure vassals will tend to stay with a liege they do not greatly despise. The special 'escalating' nature of independence wars was removed, as this mechanic makes it obsolete.
- If a ruler is deposed and their realm is already at autonomous vassals (or they are a Duke or lower), their primary-level titles will now be divided among their vassals according to De Jure pretensions, with the most participating revolter getting first pick. Muslims and Pagans who are deposed will ALWAYS have their titles divided this way.
- Removed the special Muslim/Pagan realm destruction mechanic when deposed at autonomous vassals (they will have their titles divided up instead, as outlined above).
- The AI is now less likely to join a player revolt to depose their liege (to make it harder for players to revolt purely to divide up their liege's titles).
- Children with a very high stat in their chosen education (12+) are now more likely to pick up a good trait.
- Added some tweaks that should hopefully make the AI a bit better at picking tutors for their kids.
- The level of a guardian's education trait no longer matters in itself on how well their ward takes to the education, although it is still advantageous to have for instance a Midas Touched tutor because their high stewardship skill will rub off on the ward.
- Added a fix that should prevent Republics from ending up with wrong-religion group rulers because of wonky Open Elective mechanics.
- Added Principality of Wales as a titular Duchy for any character that controls Gwynedd and at least two Duchies (or a Kingdom or Empire).
- Religious authority changes from head of religion are now less deterministic - authority can weaken even under a strong head or strengthen under a weak one, although the diplomacy, piety and learning of the head of religion plays a large role. Overall authority should trend more towards 50 rather than the extreme ends of the spectrum.
- Tweaked Finni-Ugric ruler cultures to better match the culture of their provinces.
- AI rulers should now be more willing to join military plots of other AI rulers.
- Tweaked Duchy borders in the HRE.
- Added the province of Lolland in Sjaelland to give Denmark a boost and make it so you can't usurp Denmark with just Skåne.
- Reduced frequency of epidemics, to balance for their increased lethality.
- Epidemics will now reduce the size of levies you can raise in a province afflicted by one.
- Further reduced the chance of assassination plots being leaked by backers.

1.26.5:
- It is now possible for the Pope to call a Crusade against Orthodox Constantinople under rare and very specific circumstances. For this to happen, the Pope must have a suitable personality (greedy, cynical or nuts) and there must be a history of failed Crusades against heathens in the past (yes, I realize this is not how the Fourth Crusade happened but the Fourth Crusade is impossible to properly simulate).
- Jihads now once again work like Crusades, but with two differences: The AI is sharply limited in where it will call a Jihad (preferring using them against neighbours or as a countermeasure against Crusader states) and the top contributor will always hold on to the lands taken in a Jihad, rather than creating a new independent state.
- You can no longer vassalize holy orders, to prevent various bugs and exploits related to it.
- High Crown Authority is now required to Pogrom Jews settled in your vassals' cities.
- Reduced income from Pogroms.
- All decisions on the intrigue screen should now have proper icons.
- Decadence will no longer reduce vassal loyalty, and high decadence is no longer a death sentence for a Muslim state (although it is still very undesirable).
- If you fail a plot to fabricate a claim, you now have to wait 5 years before you can attempt it again.
- One less level of dishonorable will now be inherited by your heir (so if you had 2 levels of dishonorable, your heir will get level 1 Dynastic Stain).
- Dishonorable/Dynastic Stain will now go away slowly over time, at the rate of one level per twenty years.
- A failed Crusade will now result in all attacking participants losing piety and prestige.
- Added some sanity checks that should make it impossible for a plot victim to get dishonorable as a result of an attempt on their life.
- The Immortal trait can now be inherited by children.
- Increased the opinion malus for demanding a character convert religion.
- Split Rus into the Kingdoms of Kiev, Muscowy and Novgorod.
- Russian Kings are now called Grand Princes.
- Russian Dukes are now called Princes.
- The ruler of Kiev now starts with the Kingdom of Kiev.
- Added Welsh and Cornish empires.
- Added Mizrehim culture for Persian and Middle Eastern jews.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing cultural conversion from working correctly.

1.26.4:
- Fixed another duplicate character ID issue.
- The Immortal trait should now work properly if given to a character with the ruler designer.
- The Israel title should now properly control the Jewish faith.

1.26.3:
- Fixed a duplicate character ID issue that was causing CTDs.

1.26.2:
- Integrated all character history changes from 1.06.
- Jewish characters who hold Jerusalem can now form the Kingdom of Israel, a title that makes them head of the Jewish religion.
- AI Muslim rulers are now very reluctant to join other Muslim rulers' Jihads.
- Any Muslim King or Emperor can now call a Jihad at the cost of 500 piety.
- Added Jewish Communities to the game. They are a special tax income building for cities that represents a Jewish community within a city, and which cannot be built through ordinary means. Instead, holdings that historically had Jewish communties will start the game with them, and these communities can grow and migrate throughout the game. Players with Jewish communities in their realm will get access to Jewish courtiers, and have the option to do a Pogrom - expel the Jews in their lands and seize their wealth. Jews who have been expelled will go from court to court until they find a new liege willing to shelter them in his or her cities.
- Fixed a bug that resulted in double prestige loss when switching out of Elective succession.
- Reduced base decadence growth for unlanded relatives.
- Vassals with 100 opinion of you should now never join a revolt against you.
- Removed decadence invasions. Instead, rulers with 75+ decadance will get very severe penalties to relations with their vassals.
- Muslims who execute characters of their dynasty will now get some decadence, to prevent decadence management from simply being a game of execute everyone.
- It is once again possible for Pagans and Muslims to fabricate claims (as this is necessary for expansion inside the same realm).
- If an independent Pagan or Muslim ruler is deposed or defeated in an independence war and are either a Duke or have the lowest level of Crown Authority on all their Kingdom and Empire-level titles, their realm will now be destroyed and all their non-Baron vassals become independent. Combined with the Duchy Conquest CB, this should make for Muslim and Pagan realms that expand rapidly, but are highly prone to collapse.
- Replaced Pagan/Muslim County Conquest with a Duchy Conquest CB that works like Holy War against same-religion countries but at twice the piety cost. Like Holy War, this CB cannot be used on rulers in the same realm.
- It is now easier to get sanction for Holy Wars, especially at high relations.
- The option to grant Crusade lands to a distant relative will now grant it to a suitable male relative in your realm. If no such relative exists, the option changes to granting the land to a randomly generated courtier not of your dynasty.
- Changed the requirements for recreating the Caliphates to be the same as in vanilla.
- Fixed a bug that caused assaults to be possible against cities and temples with no wall uprades even when the No Assaults module was being used.
- Removed the Mongol reinforcement events, which should reduce their ability to continously blob for decades.
- Fleshed out history files in West Africa, so that the various states there should be properly playable at any date.
- Tweaked West African borders and added some more provinces.
- Many of the culture-based Empires (for example the Frankish Empire) can now be created without holding any specific capital, as long as you are the right culture and
- Empires now require a certain amount of counties in your realm to form, in addition to holding the requisite number of Kingdom titles. Most Empires require 4 Kingdom titles and 30+ realm provinces, though the requirements for West African and East African empires are lower to make them able to form more historically.
- Crusades now only affect the attacking side's authority.
- Holy Wars now give a small amount of moral authority to the attacking side if won, and a small loss if lost. The defending side's authority is not affected either way.
- Added a large number of culture-specific formable empires. Nearly all cultures should now have their own unique empire to form.
- Martially educated characters no longer get commander traits on completing their education. Instead, they can learn up to their allowed amount of commander traits during battle.

1.26.1:
- If a vassal revolt is defeated, all participating vassals will now be imprisoned instead of just the leader.
- Disabled the use of the Not De Jure Liege trait, as the 25% revolt risk difference already coded in should be sufficient reason to want to hold de jure titles.
- Being deposed in an excommunication war will now result in a loss of Crown Authority.
- If a child ruler is deposed by his vassals, the vassal that led the revolt will now take the throne.
- Muslims will now get faster culture spread to compensate for the fact that it takes them longer to convert province religion (and thus make the province eligible for conversion).
- Changing gender succession laws now costs prestige.
- You can now change out of Elective at any time, but it will trigger a one-time vote among the Electors to determine if the new succession law is approved. High crown authority and good relations with your vassals will make it easier for the vote to pass. If the vote fails, you will not be able to try again on the same ruler.
- Bohemia now starts the game as a Kingdom, to get around it being uncreateable with the new 3 duchy rule.
- Increased the number of duchies required to form a Kingdom to 3.
- Kings may now hold up to 3 duchies personally, although Elective Kings will still get a penalty for holding more than one elector title.
- Fixed various minor bugs and typos detected by the validator.
- Tweaked genetics code to make inheritance of a genetic trait more likely if both parents have it.
- Reduced the chance of a murder plot being revealed by a backer.
- If a murder attempt on your plot target fails and is discovered, the plot will now be aborted.
- Added Khazar and (Volga) Bulgar cultures.
- Immortal characters should no longer catch infectous diseases.
- Greatly increased warscore from battles to help the AI along since it now seems far too reluctant to siege. This may unbalance smaller wars (100%+ warscore battles) due to the poor way battle warscore scales, but hopefully it should be nothing game-breaking.
- Fixed a rare bug that could make a tournament last forever in small realms.
- The county conquest CB for non-Christians now costs 250 prestige instead of 100 piety.
- Only Christians can now fabricate claims (Pagans/Muslims are meant to use county conquest instead).

1.26:
- Disabled Jihads until I can write a new system for them, as the AI will not obey weighting and the repeated conquests of Thessalonica and Croatia while Anatolia remains Byzantine are simply absurd.
- Removed the insta-game over on 100 tyranny. Instead, tyranny now increases revolt risk and higher levels of tyranny will also result in severe penalties to tax and morale.
- Offering Vassalization and Swearing Fealty now costs prestige. This is to try and prevent Empire-level realms from immediately reforming after independence wars are fought.
- The Cumans no longer start the game as an empire.
- The Kingdom of Germany is no longer held by the HRE at game start.
- Fixed a bug that could cause multiple plot murder events to fire simultaneously.
- Fixed a major bug that was breaking many random events.
- Added an optional module that disables assaults in sieges.
- Trait opinion effects are now less generic and much more dependent on opposing traits, meaning for example that fewer traits affect the opinion of all your vassals, but being Cynical will have a much greater opinion effect on your Zealous vassals. This should make it a bit harder to create an 'optimal' set of traits that makes all your vassals love you.
- The Kind trait no longer gives a combat bonus.
- The Paranoid trait now gives a combat bonus.
- The Trusting trait now gives a combat malus.

1.25.2:
- Feudal titles that have non-feudal successions (such as Investiture) should now be automatically fixed on the next maintenance pulse.
- Fixed another missing graphics bug that was causing CTDs.
- Restricted the effects of melting pots to rulers that hold land in the appropriate Kingdom (such as England for English) and their courts.
- The Il-Khanate and Golden Horde can no longer convert to another religion while at war.

1.25.1: 
- New versioning system. All versions with the same middle number (1.25.XX etc) are now tested as save game compatible.
- Re-enabled assaults with some tweaks that should hopefully stop the AI from suiciding with them.
- Fixed a bug with demesne laws that caused them to reset on loading a save (hopefully for real this time...)
- Fixed some missing graphics.
- English Longbowmen line of buildings are now available to Welsh and Cornish provinces/characters.

1.25:
- Fixed a bug with demesne laws that caused them to reset on loading a save.
- Byzantium's succession laws should now work correctly.
- Disabled assaults again (this time in a way that does not break sieges) until Paradox writes better assault AI.

1.24:
- Now compatible with version 1.06b.
- The AI will now Observe the Ramadan when their decadence is high.
- All events are now properly integrated with 1.06 event changes.
- You can now province conquest yourself into negative piety the same way you can with Holy Wars.
- Reduced the cost of creating titular titles.
- Fixed yet another bug that was making the revoke vassal title plot not show up.
- The fabricate claim plots should now work correctly.
- The gain liege title plot now uses mostly vanilla requirements.
- Adjusted education logic to take into account the lower base stats introduced in 1.06, this should make the higher level education traits less rare.
- Fixed a bug that was causing children to take the culture/religion of their educator even if their province didn't share it.

1.23:
- Fixed a CTD related to education events.
- Anglo-Norse now have access to the Saxon/English cultural buildings.
- Got rid of the Outremer melting pot as it caused some unexpected issues when European powers also had middle eastern holdings.
- It is now easier to convert Pagan provinces if you are not Pagan.
- It is now harder to convert non-Pagan provinces if you are Pagan.
- Fixed some bugs with tyranny being incorrectly given from justified imprisonments.
- Holy Wars no longer increase or decrease religious authority.
- Increased the effects of province conversions on religious authority.
- Fixed a bug where Holy Wars between different Muslim faiths would end inconclusively.
- Fixed a bug with succession on Theocracy titles, that among other things would make the Byzantine Emperor inherit the Patriarchy.
- Further tweaked moral authority to make low authority faiths more likely to 'bounce back' if a they have a high diplomacy, learning or piety head of religion.
- Immortal characters should no longer become infirm or incapable.
- It should now be easier to tell the two Caliph titles apart.

1.22:
- Fixed Muslim Theocracy succession laws to correspond to 1.06 changes.
- Thessaloncia is now De Jure Byzantium (for real this time).
- Added in some missing opinion modifiers.
- Introduced vanilla tactics system for 1.06 after some balance testing.
- The scarred trait will now get properly added to (some) characters who had been wounded.
- Fixed a duplication issue with CBs.

1.21:
- Now compatible with 1.06, with various tweaks to merge CK2+ mechanics with 1.06 mechanics. Piety cost for Muslim/Pagan conquest CB was increased to 100.
- Cut a number of features that were made superfluous by the 1.06 patch, such as the Appointed/Hereditary titles law, Concubines and the Dynamic title system.
- The effects of old age (lower health, fertility and martial, higher learning) has been made transparent to the player in the form of an 'Old' trait given at age 50, whose effects progressively increase as a character grows older.
- AI rulers are now much less likely to go native if their culture has little in common with the culture of their capital (for instance, Greeks are unlikely to go Turkish and vice versa).
- Fixed a bug where plots against your liege were unavailable because you were the primary heir to an unrelated title.
- The decisions for Feast, Summer Fair and Grand Hunt can now be executed at any time of the year, though the event itself will not occur until the proper month (so if you use the Grand Hunt decision in March, it will occur in September of the same year, but if you use it between September and October it will occur instantly). Note that you can still only do each of these once per year.
- Tweaked buildings to add some additional requirements for the higher level buildings and reduce the bloated late-game levies caused by stacking levy size modifiers.
- You can no longer be excommunicated for holding Rome if you have an Anti-Pope in your realm.
- Children who are not assigned a guardian should now get one assigned to them automatically within a few months. This will happen less quickly for close relatives of the ruler.
- Reduced the average number of personality traits characters should end up with, as trait bloating tends to get a bit ridiculous at times.
- Added the Outremer Empire as a formable title.
- Slowed down the spread of heresy.
- Large realms should now be a bit more prone to collapsing into independent states.
- Reaching 100 (max) tyranny will now result in being deposed in favor of a different dynasty (meaning Game Over for the player).
- Armies at sea are now at risk of being hit by a storm that will kill a large portion of the embarked forces. It is therefore a good idea to minimize the amount of time your troops spend at sea (and no longer wise to use embarked troops as a mobile reserve to trick the AI with).
- Added a decision to repay a loan, if you have the money and want to do it before the due date.
- The AI will no longer hand out certain large Kingdoms to vassals (for example they will hold on to Rus, France and Germany).
- The AI will no longer hand Kingdoms to vassals not of their culture group.
- Added an Anglo-Norse melting pot for Scandinavians that conquer Anglo-Saxon provinces.
- Added an Outremer melting pot for Iberians/Latins that conquer land in Egypt or Jerusalem/Syria.

1.20:
- Fixed a bug where Thessalonica was not de jure Byzantium on game start.
- Added more titular empires and made certain titular empires available to all cultures. The goal is to have at least one culture-specific empire for each culture, plus one 'available to all' option for each major region. A complete list of currently formable Empires and their requirements will be made available in the next few days.
- Added a workaround to correct an issue where vassals granted titles via event would become a vassal of your liege instead of yourself.
- Increased frequency of random genetic traits in newborns.
- You will no longer be able to escape the consequenses of defaulting on a loan by dying.
- Consequenses of defaulting on a loan now last longer.
- If you default on a loan you will now be unable to take another in your lifetime.
- You can now plot to kill any character in the game.
- If your murder plot is revealed before it is put in action, you may now become dishonorable as a consequense.
- You no longer get a decision to kill characters with plots. Instead, you have to wait for an event to fire that gives you the option on whether to strike with your current plot power, wait for a better opportunity, or call it off altogether. Higher plot power and more backers will make the event fire sooner. Note that this makes it possibly to execute kill plots with very low plot power (as long as you have at least one backer), although you will have very poor odds of success.
- Fixed a bug where maintenance would incorrectly remove the Appointed/Hereditary titles law from Byzantium.
- Emperors will now hand out King-level titles to loyal vassals, though they will always retain at least one King title for themselves.

1.19:
- Fixed some bugs in the dynamic title system related to the AI creating Kingdoms.
- Fixed a bug where non-Muslim rulers could end up with Open succession as a result of conquering land. The succession will now auto-correct on the next maintenance pulse.
- Reverted to old civil war system as the new one seems to not be working properly.

1.18:
- Fixed a game-breaking bug where the Pope would not, in fact, be wearing a Pope hat.
- Provinces are now converted faster if there is an adjoining province of the same culture or culture group of the religion you are trying to convert to.
- 40% moral authority is now required for calling a Crusade or Jihad, to prevent a death spiral of failed Crusades killing off moral authority.
- Tweaked moral authority to increase faster as a result of a competent head of religion.
- West Africa is no longer accessible by ship, to make it more appropriately isolated from the rest of the world.
- State martial score now increases minimum levy size.
- State intrigue now reduces revolt risk in provinces.
- After some consideration, I have restored the old stewardship demense size variable (1 per 10). Instead of nerfing stewardship, I will be aiming to increase the effects of the other stats to make them just as useful.

1.17:
- Simplified the Tyranny system. Instead of a variable amount of Tyranny based on rank and cause, any action that gave the tyrant opinion modifier in vanilla will now give an appropriate amount of tyranny that is now shown in the tooltip when carrying out the action. This was the only way to correct a number of bugs with actions giving tyranny when they shouldn't be. As a result the system is now less flexible but much easier to understand. Tyranny costs are now as follows: 10/20 for unlawfully imprisoning a courtier/vassal, 5/10 for executing a courtier/vassal, 0/20 for banishing a courtier/vassal.
- Fixed more bugs with succession laws.
- Culture-specific buildings will no longer be destroyed unless the culture of the province changes, although you will still be unable to build them unless you are of the appropriate culture.

1.16:
- Added more culture-specific buildings.
- Slightly increased effects of stewardship on demesne size.
- Fixed a bug with tourneys that caused them to not end correctly.
- Fixed some bugs with localisation and graphics on the 'Befriend Top Liege' ambition.
- Reduced the effects of difficulty on councillor actions (they were a bit extreme).
- Fixed some problems with the loading order of the mod.
- Fixed a bug where a woman could become simultaneously pregnant with her spouse and her lover.

1.15:
- Now compatible with version 1.05g.
- Upgraded to the latest version of Better Looking Characters, which features a number of performance improvements that should make it less memory intensive.
- Integrated Mercator Mod, which improves greatly on the game's terrain with proper mountain placement, river locations, etc.
- Titular titles will now never be elective when created.
- If your demesne laws are higher than what crown authority allows (for example because crown authority went down) an event will now fire that adjusts them to their highest allowed level.
- Added events for pious Muslim or Christian rulers to sponsor missions to a neighbouring Pagan ruler, which have a chance of converting that ruler to the sponsor's faith.
- Reworked the effects of difficulty. Instead of providing flat bonuses to the player or the AI, difficulty now instead influences things such as councillor actions, loans and vassal loyalty. A player on low difficulty will (to name a few effects) find it easier to fabricate claims and have vassals stay loyal during civil wars, while getting the opposite effect on high difficulty. A high difficulty AI will get more claims, better terms on loans and other such things to make up for its various shortcomings versus a player. On Normal, AIs play almost entirely by the same rules as a player. Only a single flat bonus was left in place: Siege speed. High difficulty AIs will be more difficult to siege to account for their tendency to only siege a single province at once.
- Victory in a succession war will now result in taking all the enemy's titles you have claims on in addition to taking the title whose succession you were disputing.
- Reworked civil wars. Vassals who choose to side with their liege will now actively join the war and raise their troops to fight the traitors. To compensate for this, the base chance of vassals joining a civil war was increased.
- AI vassals will now be reluctant to rebel against an AI ruler that has recently been in a civil war.
- It is once again possible for your character's culture to spread to your capital, even if there is no adjacent province of the same culture. The chance is greatly reduced unless your character is independent.
- Neighbours will no longer get a religious call to arms when war is declared between characters of the same religion group (as long as one is not a heresy of the other).
- Further refined education formula. The child's attributes are now more important than the tutor's trait in how well they take to their education, though educator trait still makes a significant difference. Overall frequency of level 3 and 4 education traits were lowered.
- Nearly all decisions now have graphical icons to make them more immediately visually identifiable.
- Martial skill is now much more important in determining who wins a grand tournament.
- Upped Kingdom creation cost to 500 gold and Empire creation cost to 1000 gold.
- Further decreased effects of personal stewardship on demesne limit.
- Removed piety cost for Kingdom creation. While it makes sense for Catholics, it doesn't for pretty much every other faith and it always felt strange how impious, ambitious characters were locked out of making themselves Kings.
- AI rulers will now only attempt to Restore the Papacy once after it is lost. If they make the attempt and fail, the same character will not try again.
- Attempts to Restore the Papacy to Rome can now only be made for 100 years after it is lost.
- De Jure claim wars now always result in seizing the province, to prevent the situations where you would force-vassalize a character and he would revolt immediately as the war ends.
- State martial skill now influences the amount of troops you can raise from your vassals.
- The AI will now usurp Kingdoms that it controls more than 50% of the land in, even if it already has a Kingdom or Empire level title.
- The AI will no longer limit itself to a single Kingdom, creating any Kingdom titles it is eligible for with the exception of titles inside a de jure empire that it holds.
- Added titular Kingdoms of Bavaria, Prussia and Khazaria.
- If a titular kingdom turns de jure, the special creation/usurp penalties from it are now removed (so if the Kingdom of Venice has de jure land, it is no longer only holdable by republics, for example).
- Players without an ambition will now suffer a penalty to their prestige (to prevent an exploit where the player would only pick ambitions as they are about to complete).
- Removed the 'No New Empires' module (as it no longer serves a purpose).
- Implemented a new system of dynamic empires. All de jure Empires except the HRE and Byzantium are now gone, and are instead replaced by a large number of titular empires that can be formed by any ruler with the right culture and 4 kingdom titles. The following empires are currently createable via this system: Latin Empire, Frankish Empire, Occitan Empire, Italian Empire, Roman Empire, Polish Empire, Russian Empire, Persian Empire, Danubian Empire, Spanish Empire, Maghreb Empire, Arabian Empire, Egyptian Empire, Celtic Empire, Nordic Empire, Ethiopian Empire, Britannian Empire, Mali Empire, Lithuanian Empire, Finnish Empire, Magyar Empire, Seljuk Turks, Ottoman Empire and Al-Andalus.
- Removed all religion limits on creating de jure kingdom titles. Instead, some titles will have an 'alternate' version for muslims, and on creating that title the non-muslim title will be destroyed and the muslim title will take its place. If the muslim title is then destroyed and re-created by christians or pagans, it reverts to the non-muslim version. (For example: If a muslim ruler creates Portugal, he will get the Sultanate of Al-Garb instead, with Portugal's de jure lands. If his realm is wiped out and Al-Garb is created by a Christian, that Christian will get the Kingdom of Portugal).
- Fixed some bugs related to starting succession laws. As a result, you will be unable to change succession laws in the first week or so after starting a new game.
- Heresies no longer affect or are affected by moral authority changes from Holy Wars and province conversion.
- Courtiers can now take lovers among other courtiers, and young men or women with much older spouses will be particularily suspectible to romance.
- Changing succession laws now requires and costs 125/250/500/750/1000 prestige for Barons/Counts/Dukes/Kings/Emperors respectively. Changing gender succession laws does not cost prestige.
- Removed crown law requirements for switching succession laws. Medium Crown Authority is still required for switching an Elective Kingdom or Empire away from being Elective.
- You can no longer complete the 'Amass Wealth' objective by taking a loan.
- Increased base amount of troops from holdings.
- Increased build cost of holdings.
- Fixed a bug that caused countries to incorrectly become independent when a third-party claim was pressed.
- Revamped tyranny mechanics. When you perform tyrannical actions (such as imprisoning, banishing or executing characters) without a rightful cause, you will now get tyranny 'points' that translate into a Tyrant trait with a potency from 1 to 100. For each point of tyranny, you suffer penalties to prestige and vassal opinion. Imprisoning and executing characters when you have rightful cause to do so (for example if they rebelled against you) will not result in any tyranny, and the tyranny penalties for banishment are lowered if you have rightful cause. Note that a character revolting/acting dishonorably towards you will only give you cause for ONE punishment, so you can either revoke, banish OR execute them... additional punishments will result in normal amounts of tyranny. Tyranny goes away over time, and will not be inherited by your successor when you die.
- You will now get kinslayer only for executing or assassinating close relatives (rather than any dynasty member).
- Fixed some issues with weird/conflicting assassination plot requirements.
- AI characters that have been caught assassinating before are now less likely to plan new assassinations.
- A character that wins an invasion will now get claims on all Counties and Duchies in the target Kingdom.
- You can no longer pick the ambition to befriend a character you are at war with (and the ambition will abort if you go to war with them).
- Added an ambition to befriend your top liege (if not the same as your direct liege).

1.14:
- Better Looking Characters is now an optional module that requires the Mongol Faces DLC. If you are having issues with graphics, performance or load times, try playing without BLC as it increases CK2's memory usage considerably.

1.13:
- Upgraded to version 7 of Better Looking Characters.
- Fixed a bug that was causing feasts, hunting and summer fairs to become permanently unavailable for a character.
- Jews can now create the Kingdom of Jerusalem.
- Harder difficulty levels will no longer increase AI income, but will lower player income instead (for players who think money is too plentiful).
- Tweaked a vanilla event that was causing Catholic moral authority to increase far too quickly.
- How you vote on your liege's law proposals will now influence his or her opinion of you.
- Fixed a rare bug that would result in characters being given two education traits.
- Further decreased chances of children picking up the higher level education traits.
- When a character usurps  their liege's primary title, they will now also take the liege's capital province (so that if a pretender seizes the Byzantine Empire they should also get Constantinople, for example).
- Corrected some newly introduced performance issues.
- Courtiers with honorary titles and money will now marry on their own unless that honorary title is Court Jester or Concubine.
- Extending a loan will now only extend it for two years.
- Exiling characters now costs prestige, to prevent an exploit where a low ranked player could repeatedly imprison and banish his baron vassals for large sums of money.
- Players can now complete many ambitions multiple times, although the rewards for completing them are greatly lessened after the first time.
- Fixed a bug where lack of crown laws would incorrectly reset your demesne laws to the lowest level.
- Fixed some bugs with lover events where women could get impregnated by their female lovers.
- Female councillors will no longer marry other women.

1.12:
- Now compatible with official patch 1.05f.
- Upgraded to latest version of Culturally Different Cities.
- The Komnenos dynasty now starts with claims to Byzantium in 1066.
- Kingdoms and Empires must now have at least Medium crown authority to fight a de jure war over a province whose Duchy they do not control.
- Removed the attribute nerfs on birth since new education system makes them redundant (and I can always just tweak good education trait chances down if stat inflation becomes a problem again).
- Added a new education system. Children will now get an education trait sometime between the age of 15 and 16 instead of getting it on their 16th birthday. The trait they get will always be the same archetype as their tutor (ie a tutor with an intrigue trait will generate an intrigue trait for their student) but which trait the child gets is now influenced by the child's own attributes, so a high martial child is likely to do well in a martial education for example. Randomization was also increased so the child doesn't just get the exact same trait as their tutor almost every time. Overall, the higher end education traits should now be significantly rarer.
- Added a notification event that fires when one of your close relatives turns 16, letting you know that they are an adult and which education trait they got (to compensate for the lack of an education notification).
- Reduced the power/cost of universities and increased the power/cost of monastic schools, to make Temples the foremost holding for research speed.
- Decreased the chance of healthy women dying in childbirth.
- Upgraded to latest version of family relations mod.
- Sped up the spread of English and Sicilian cultures.
- The learning and piety of a head of religion will now influence the moral authority of that religion through events.
- Randomly generated characters (both at game start and after) should now properly get assigned genetic traits.
- Removed the Arrange Courtier Marriages decision. Instead, courtiers with money and a position on your council will marry on their own.
- Reduced the piety cost of early Crusades, to make Crusade-less games less likely.
- When you win an independence war, the defeated ruler will now get claims on your titles.
- Changed the way loans work. Instead of an event that fires when you go into the red, a loan can now be taken at any time through a decision. The loan amount scales to your income, and is always a five-year loan at 25% interest. If you do not have the money to pay it back on the due date, you can extend it for another five years by paying the interest. If your character dies with an unpaid loan, the debt will be transfered to your heir.
- The AI will now make use of loans during wartime in order to buy mercenaries and fund its armies.
- AI will now only change succession laws under fairly specific circumstances (so half the world won't switch to Primogeniture on day one of the game).
- Reduced the penalty for characters dying in prison.
- Reduced the chance of prisoners in the dungeon falling ill.
- Imprisoned characters can no longer join a revolt.
- Increased the chance of characters with titles escaping from prison. The higher ranked the character, the higher the chance of them making the attempt.
- Reduced starting troop multiplier for Alp Arslan (due to the changes below).
- Added more buildings to the Seljuk Turks and increased the strength of the Ghilmans.
- Removed some holdings in Byzantium and reduced the strength of the Varangian Guard.
- Further improved performance by removing some unnecessary AI checks and moving others to events.
- Added two new ambitions: Befriend Liege and Befriend Head of Religion.
- Building destruction on siege events should now work correctly.
- Added two events associated with the 'Research Economy Tech' action. The positive event improves province prosperity, while the negative event results in temporary revolt risk.
- Center leader martial skill is now a very important factor for reducing attrition to your troops.
- Reduced the effects of Siege Equipment, to balance out for the removal of Military Fortifications.
- Replaced the Military Fortifications tech with Logistics, which increases supply limits to better correspond to later game army sizes.
- Attrition is once again a factor in war, although at greatly reduced maximum rates and heavily tweaked holding supply effects.
- Reduced garrison sizes to make stalled wars less likely.
- Increased effectiveness of defending garrison during assaults (to make up for lower numbers).
- Tweaked province prosperity events so that the extreme ends of the spectrum (Rich/Struggling) are less common.
- When pushing third-party claims, the tooltip will no longer say that the claimaint will become your landed vassal if that is not possible because the pushed title is equal or higher rank than your own.
- When pushing third-party claims, the claimaint will now remain your vassal if the title you are pushing is in the same realm as your own (ie held by your liege or one of his/her vassals).
- Pushing a third-party claim will no longer turn a character independent if the title you pushed for him or her was not already independent.
- You can now plot to kill characters whose title you or your child is a pretender to.
- Removed the demesne size requirements for raising crown authority, as they all too often locked the AI at autonomous vassals.
- Most titles formable by Christians are now also formable by Pagans.
- Kingdom of Wends can now be formed by Wends of any religion.

1.11:
- Fixed a CTD on startup caused by the lack of congenital/birth traits.

1.10:
- Fixed a bug that was causing characters to get dynastic stain when they should not be.
- Fixed a bug that was causing regency trait not to be applied properly.
- Fixed a bug that was causing congenital traits not to be distributed properly.
- Learning will now influence province prosperity, so a high state learning will make it more likely for your provinces to grow prosperous and less likely for them to become poor.
- The AI will now favor vassals that have the 'Gain Honorary Title' ambition when handing out honorary titles.
- Increased opinion bonus for dynasty back to +10.
- Reduced opinion bonus for sibling from 20 to 15.
- Reintroduced monthly authority loss for creating an Anti-Pope, but greatly reduced the initial authority loss (This should make Anti-Popes a 'hot potato').

1.09:
- Fixed a bug that was causing significant slowdown due to bloated AI courts. Game performance should now be much better.
- Moved most CK2+ events to the yearly or bi-yearly character event pulses to further improve performance.
- Increased AI tendency to plot.
- Reduced opinion bonus for same dynasty.
- Integrated avee's family relations mod that increases character's opinions of their close family.
- Realms without crown authority can now have up to the second level of taxation/levy laws.
- Fixed a bug that was breaking the invasion CB.
- Further improved title distribution AI, to make the AI less willing to hand away its demesne when there are other alternatives.
- Added dynasty, culture and religion information to character tooltips.
- Reduced minimum gift size (but kept the increased gift scaled cost the same).
- Increased the plot power required to execute the better assassination decisions, and also slightly increased their chance of success.
- Removed Castellans. While I feel they are a good feature, I couldn't find a way to fix the various bugs and issues with the way honorary titles are coded, and I don't want to have a permanently half-broken feature in the mod.
- Greatly increased prestige gain from winning battles.
- Reworked the way joining wars works. The ask to join war diplomatic mechanic is now reserved solely for Crusades. Instead, when a ruler is declared on by a ruler of a different faith for any conquest-type CB (holy war, claim, de jure claim, etc), they get the option to ask all their neighbours of the same faith (neighbour being defined as sharing a border or sharing provinces in the same kingdom). Chance of joining depends on relations, traits, dynastic ties and other such factors. This should make the AI far more reasonable and realistic about which holy wars it joins (you no longer get all of North Africa defending Sicily, for instance), and simultaneously eliminates the exploit of using other CBs to get around holy war defensive chains.
- Reduced demesne size requirements for raising crown authority to a level the AI can better cope with.
- Buildings can now be randomly destroyed as a consequense of provinces being besieged.
- Added province prosperity mechanics. Provinces now have a prosperity level that goes (in descending order): Rich - Prosperous - Normal - Poor - Struggling. Prosperity level affects the tax and levies you can get from the province, and will go up and down from various events. Peace and quiet tends to increase province prosperity, while war and rebellions reduces it.
- Restored the ability for women to pass on pressable claims to their kids. This makes it possible once again to marry into claims.
- Province conversions will now very slightly increase the moral authority of the converting religion, and decrease the authority of the converted.
- Religions no longer gain any moral authority from the diplomacy of their head of religion.
- Anti-Popes no longer cause continous moral authority loss, but the moral authority loss from creating one was greatly increased.
- Reduced the moral authority hit to the loser in a Crusade.
- Reduced frequency of heresies.
- Reduced maintenance cost of levies.
- Reduced the bonus troops granted to rulers defending against a Crusade/Jihad.
- The Almoravids once again start as a Sultanate instead of an Emirate, as this leads to more historical results.
- Fixed a bug where the Pope getting the land in a Crusade would result in a smattering of independent counts.
- The inherited/appointed titles law is now available to Byzantium (to represent the Theme system).
- Added the titular kingdoms of Sardinia, Dublin, Mann and the Isles, Mercia and Cornwall.
- Newborn characters now start with negative stats, in an effort to reduce the extreme stat inflation from education over time. An adjustment event fires later in childhood to ensure that base stats do not remain in the negative.
- Removed the vassal opinion bonus from Elective. While it makes sense, it feel it makes an already extremely good succession law even better.
- Primogeniture no longer lowers the opínion of your dynasty.
- Elective now lowers the opinion of your dynasty (due to opening up the succession outside of the bloodline).
- Tweaked mercenaries to have more 500 and 1000-size companies.
- Added mercenaries to West Africa.
- Tweaked provinces in West Africa and added an additional province to the Duchy of Laayoune.
- Fixed a bug where changing the crown authority of an Empire would cause multiple stacking opinion penalties.

1.08:
- Players can now do De Jure wars against other religion groups, until I rework the way joining Holy Wars works.
- Tumbling your courtiers is no longer a male-only or straight-only activity.
- Crusader states should now always become Feudal, even if the most participating attacker in the Crusade is not.
- Halved the effects of legalism on demesne size.
- Vassals will no longer join a claim on liege war that is not targeting one of the liege's primary-level titles. This should prevent situations where you are fighting your liege for a claim on a vassal and that vassal joins the war on your side.
- Tweaked West Africa to be slightly more historical and considerably more balanced.
- Increased frequency of bad events (buildings destroyed, characters killed, armies rising up) from revolts.
- Restored economic buildings to former levels, with the exception of ports as they made coastal cities rather overpowered at their previous income levels.
- If you press a claim of lower rank than their primary title on behalf of a vassal, they will now stay in your realm (so you can press Count claims on behalf of Dukes, etc).
- Fixed some issues with weird straits caused by province realigning.
- You can no longer declare third-party de jure wars on characters of a different religion group.

1.07:
- Now compatible with version 1.05e.
- Ran the mod through the validator and fixed numerous minor errors.
- De Jure vassals are now more inclined to choose depose CBs over independence war CBs.
- Reduced the number of short reign years but increased the opinion penalties for Regency, to make succession issues rarer but more serious.
- Reduced the opinion boost for being entrusted with a ward.
- Increased the cost of gifts, to make the cost better scaled to how powerful they have become (I would reduce their opinion effects if I could).
- Reduced the dynastic opinion bonus to 15 on account of the tendency of dynasty members to stay loyal during revolts by non-dynasty members and the reduced opinion maluses from title claimaints.
- The cost of fabricating claims now scales with your primary title level. Fabricating a claim on a County/Duchy costs 100/200, 150/300 and 200/400 for Counts, Dukes and Kings/Emperors respectively.
- A character that wins their invasion war (for example, William the Conqueror if he wins the Norman Invasion) now gains a ten-year truce modifier that prevents all external wars, in the same way newly formed crusader states do.
- Holy Orders will now get the ten-year truce modifier when they are granted a piece of land via event.
- The negative effects of bankruptcy now scale, with increasing penalties for every 250 gold you owe up to a maximum of 1000.
- It is no longer possible to create the Mongol/Timurid titles.
- Fixed numerous bugs with depose type CBs where wars would not end properly or revolters would become independent as a result of an abdication. As a part of these fixes, it will now take 1 day between the end of a successful depose war and the actual abdication of the loser.
- Oman now starts independent. I realize this is ahistorical, but equally ahistorical is the fact that it becomes the final holdout of the Seljuk Turks in most games, and I feel having it independent improves gameplay in the area.
- Cumans are now an Empire and Cherson is now in the Kingdom of Crimea. This was done to try and prevent Cumans from always ending up as a de jure title.
- Increased prestige gain for marrying into prestigious dynasties.
- Icelandic is now a separate culture.
- You can no longer fight De Jure wars against characters of a different religion group, to prevent them being used to get around the Holy War defensive chains.
- Reduced Holy Order cost back to 50 piety.
- Muslims can now only appoint a single concubine, as court sizes quickly get ridiculous with three of them.
- Added barony names, starting baronies and a reasonable number of barony slots to West Africa, so the area is now actually worth playing in. Many of the barony names have no historical grounds (named after modern settlements) so any input on name replacements from people knowledgeable of medieval West Africa would be welcome.
- Split Mauretania into the Kingdoms of Mauretania and Morocco.
- Integrated the All the Way to Timbuktu mod that adds 30 new provinces in West Africa, along with three new Kingdoms and a new Empire.
- Integrated Syren's Nicknames Mod with over 90 new ruler nicknames.
- Integrated Better Looking Characters mod. The parts that require the Mongol Faces DLC were placed in the optional module 'Mongol Faces'.
- The Papal State is now an Empire, both to prevent the Pope from being vassalized and to prevent the Papal State from assimiliating Spoleto.
- Removed the building cost reduction on oversee construction, but made it so the 'Meets Master Builder' event lowers the cost of all construction in the province by 20% for 10 years.
- Reduced the tax bonus from having your Steward collect taxes.
- Reduced the power of economic buildings. On average, a tax income building will pay itself back in 100 years.
- Pressing claims on behalf of claimaints now works as in vanilla, where a character will only become your landed vassal if they are your de jure vassal or of your dynasty.
- There are now three Muslim Titlar Kingdoms in Iberia: Al-Mawsat (Capital: Granada), Al-Xarq (Capital: Porto) and Al-Garb (Capital: Zaragoza). A ruler that holds all three can form the Titular Empire of Al-Andalus.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing Crusade/Jihad notifications from working properly.
- The AI must now spend some piety to call a Crusade or Jihad (preventing repeated failed Crusades by the same character).
- A ruler defending against a Crusade or Jihad can now call on a very large portion of their levies (players cannot do so if they are also fighting an offensive war).

1.06:
- Now compatible with 1.05d.
- Tweaked the Duchies in Syria and Mesopotamia.
- Mongol armies now vary from anywhere between 40k and 100k troops.
- Mongol titles are no longer 'landless', as this resulted in far too many little issues with succession and CBs. Instead, they will now seize a chunk of land around their starting province when they alive, and will be destroyed if their last county is taken. This should fix all the major bugs with Mongols not arriving, having weird successions, etc. As a side effect this also makes it possible to play as the Mongols.
- Properly implemented the 'gain a vassal title' plot.
- Increased chance of heresies appearing.
- Feudal taxation now goes from 5-25% instead of 0-40%, meaning that Feudal vassals are no longer completely tax exempt. This was done to add more of noticeable drawback for the player to be a vassal, since unlike vanilla your liege generally can't call on a significant portion of your troops.
- Slightly increased opinion malus for appointing a Castellan.
- If a Castellan revolts when you try to dismiss him, you will now gain claims on all his titles.
- You can now only appoint a single Castellan (reduced down from two).
- Castellans that are given King titles, numerous Duke titles or a large number of vassals are now more likely to revolt if you try to dismiss them.
- Rulers can now get claims on neighbouring titles via a random event.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing the cooldown on Crusades/Jihads from working correctly.
- Crusades targeting a De Jure Kingdom of an existing Emperor of the same religion will now grant the land to that Emperor (so a Crusade targeting Germany would give the land taken to the HRE).
- When winning lands in a Crusade, you will now get an event that allows you to set up a relative as an independent ruler of a Crusader state, though you may also choose to hold on to the land as before.
- Fixed a bug that caused the Regency trait to not be removed correctly.
- Reduced the frequency of spouses falling in love with each other (it was happening rather too often since the event could fire for either spouse).
- Upped the piety cost of players calling Crusades/Jihads to 500.
- Added a 20 year cooldown on the player calling Crusades/Jihads.

1.05:
- Fixed a major issue that was causing certain CBs not to work.
- The AI will no longer grant Duchies to characters of a different religion.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing Pagan bonus buildings from working.
- The King of Nubia in 1066 is now the correct culture.
- Calling a Crusade or Jihad now costs and requires 250 piety if the player is the one calling it.

1.04:
- Ported over all vanilla character history changes from 1.05.
- Added the decision to appoint up to two male, unlanded, non-primary heir characters as Castellans. Castellans are appointed governors of any titles you grant them, which can be retaken at any time with the 'Dismiss Castellan' decision, allowing you to use them as temporary governors of territory you cannot currently hold yourself, or wish to reserve for a relative in the future. The downside to Castellans is that they are much less efficient at ruling their territories, and will give you less 33% less tax and levies than an ordinary, landed vassal. Appointing Castellans will also slightly upset your hereditary vassals, who do not like the idea of appointed rulers. Muslims do not get Castellans since they have their own appointed ruler system. If a Castellan dies or inherits land, he immediately ceases to be a Castellan and his lands (not including any inheritance) returns to you.
- Empire-level titles will now inherit all laws properly from your primary title on creation.
- Investiture and Title crown laws are now tied to their De Jure Empire in the same way as crown authority.
- You can now press claims for female characters on titles with Cognatic succession. I tested allowing pressing claims on Agnatic-Cognatic but it made expansion far too easy by simply pressing claims for your wife.
- Increased piety cost of hiring Holy Orders.
- Holy Orders will now properly scale with time and religious authority.
- Reworked holy order troop composition to give some variety and also to prevent some holy orders from having an excess amount of certain troop types by end game.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing the 'rebel army rises up' event from firing.
- Heresies now scale better to authority, so you get a gradual decrease/increase of heresies as authority goes up/down rather than a few massive thresholds.
- Reduced the base chance of heresies appearing.
- Reduced the effect of head of religion diplomacy on religious authority. The default state of Catholicism should no longer be 100%.
- Highway Robber Bands, Thieves' Guilds and Smuggler Rings can now appear for rulers without an oversized demesne if their realm stats are low.
- Childbirth deaths will now show up correctly as a death cause.
- Fixed some issues with broken death localisations.
- Reduced province de jure integration time back to 100 years.
- Pagans can now create Scandinavia and all its Kingdom titles.
- Removed all title creation exceptions for non-AI players. Muslim players can no longer create France, etc.
- Dutch provinces can now build the squire list line of buildings. This is a placeholder until I can give them their own building series.
- Many more titular titles are now createable.
- AI characters with the right traits may now choose to hold to Rome despite the Pope's demands.
- Added a CB for Catholic rulers to return Rome to the Pope if another ruler takes it.
- The Pope will now only ask for Rome back once. You won't get the same request for future rulers unless he took it back inbetween.
- Fixed a reversed localisation when rulers join the enemy side in a war.
- Rolled all the Holy War/Religious Invasion CBs into a single Holy War CB with varying piety costs depending on distance and sanction. This was done because the AI did not recognize the new religious CBs and would not join in defensively.
- Reduced AI willingness to join Holy Wars and Crusades.
- Removed the intrigue requirement on starting plots, but made low-intrigue AI characters unlikely to use them.
- Eased up on opinion restrictions on murder plots, especially for characters with traits such as ambitious and cruel.
- Crusades can no longer be declared against heretics, as this resulted in some extremely absurd situations.
- Winning a crusade will no longer give you the Kingdom title, as this resulted in absurdities like an english Duke becoming the King of Germany because of a crusade declared against Mecklenburg.
- Long reign now starts at year 20 instead of year 10.
- Increased opinion malus for denying a vassal a title when they request it via event.
- Reduced the opinion malusus from desiring titles and Not De Jure Liege. Since civil wars are now much more dangerous, I feel that it is a good idea to reduce their frequency a bit, especially to make the AI a more challenging opponent. The effects of these may be raised again if it makes the world too stable.
- The regency triggered modifier is now a trait, that only affects vassal opinion instead of general opinion.
- When a vassal revolts to depose their liege (either via one of the three depose CBs or through a succession crisis), all other vassals will now get an event where they can choose whether or not to join in the revolt. The chance to join depends on traits, relations and dynastic relationships. This should make it significantly more dangerous to provoke your vassals into revolting, since even a small revolt can spiral out of control.
- Tweaked crusade weight chances to cut down on crusades against Sicily and the Wends.
- Added the createable titular kingdom of Aquitaine. Aquitaine can only be created by Occitains that control Bordeaux, and since it is a King-level title you must be independent or the vassal of an Emperor to create it.
- Removed Republic bonus buildings.
- Removed Papal bonus buildings.
- Reduced the power of Pagan bonus buildings.
- Added 1.05's Kingdom/Empire De Jure CBs as an experiment to see whether it has the negative effects on balance that I feared.
- Fixed a bug that was causing friends not to work correctly.
- Disabled the wrong religion occupation penalty, as I feel Holy Wars have been slowed down / made difficult enough that it is not necessary.
- Reduced warscore from battles.
- Fixed some bugs where the 'Win a War' ambition would not complete correctly.
- Fixed a bug with asking for a Sanctioned Holy War where nothing would happen when you took the decision.
- Removed the optional heraldry module until a version can be made that works with the 1.05c patch.
- Fixed a bug where Crusader/Mujahid would not be properly assigned to characters.
- Split up or tweaked many of the largest duchies to make duchy sizes more consistent between different regions.

1.03:
- Added crusade weighting for Kingdoms, so crusades/jihads are not totally random.
- Muslims now have their own Mujahid trait instead of getting the Crusader trait.
- Emperors can no longer create King titles they are the De Jure liege of (to prevent some very ahistorical title creation).
- The character designer will now work properly with CK2+ (ie you can no longer start as a pregnant, beheaded man).
- Reduced the power of republic levy building and made it cost money to build in holdings that do not start with it.
- Made the special republic CB cost prestige to slow down their blobbing.
- Added new CoA patterns from 1.05 to Heraldry mod.
- Fixed a bug that was causing the game to crash if you tried to start after 1204.
- Characters can now plot to assassinate rivals.
- Rügen is now a de jure part of Pomerania.
- Now uses vanilla death reasons instead of death causes mod.

1.02:
- Now compatible with 1.05c. Certain things (like the Kingdom/Empire de jure CBs) were not ported because I feel they break gameplay balance.
- Reduced supply limits experimentally, to see how the improved military AI works out.
- Tribal Invasion CB now targets Kingdoms instead of Duchies.
- Upped De Jure assimilation rate to 200 years.
- Titular Kingdoms (such as the Wends) are now created through 1.05's create titular title mechanic instead of via decision.
- Reduced revolt risk from distance.
- Removed the civil war modifier for now, to see how the new +revolt risk from independence revolts works out. Regency modifier is still in place.
- Removed the war of independence winning all wars of independence mechanic, since new ticking warscore makes it redundant.
- Tweaked the way traits affect piety. All virtues will now give at least a small amount of monthly piety, while all sins will give at least a small malus. The effects of traits such as humble, chaste and lustful that already affected piety were tweaked down to compensate.
- A player that is holding a 'landless' title (such as a mercenary company or a holy order) will now receive a one-time warning that doing so can cause severe bugs with the game.
- Fixed a bug where Kingdom-level titles would sometimes not be grantable to your vassals.
- Rulers whose religion has a religious head can now request sanction for a Holy War or Religious Invasion at a small prestige cost. If granted, it will allow them to wage a Sanctioned Holy War/Religious Invasion that has no piety cost and will give you some piety if you win it. The chance of sanction being granted depends on your piety and head of religion's opinion of you. Requesting sanction can only be done once every five years.
- The AI will now be less keen on doling out its entire demesne to its sons.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing the 'ruler goes native' event from firing.
- Fixed a bug that was causing you to get tyranny when a prisoner died in house arrest.
- Muslims can now get the Crusader trait for participating in Jihads. I will likely make a separate Jihadist trait at some point in the future.
- Temple holdings now give the province they're built in a 10% research boost, even if they don't have any research buildings built.
- You can no longer reorganize flanks. Until Paradox fixes the inherent balance issues with flanks the only real use for this is for player-only exploits.
- Reduced the size of the Norman, English and Norwegian armies in the Stamford Bridge scenario. While the armies are now smaller than they were historically, they are no longer confusingly out of sync with the actual army sizes in the rest of the mod.
- CK2Plus now features full French localisation.
- When taking or extending a loan you will now get a character modifier showing you when the loan is due.
- Restored the family trees that were broken to prevent certain claims from existing. Instead, those claims will be removed by a startup event that fires shortly after game start.
- You must no longer have the prestige on hand to fabricate claims, but you cannot fabricate claims if your prestige is below 0.
- The final level of Heavy Armor is now actually an upgrade.
- Titles created by decision will now inherit the succession law of your primary title (no more forming Empires with Gavelkind).
- You can no longer grant independence to De Jure vassals, to prevent certain exploits with De Jure CBs.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing the AI from abandoning certain failed plots and objectives.
- Renamed 'Get a Lover' to 'Fall in Love' to make it more appropriate for when the ambition is completed by falling in love with your spouse.
- Fixed a bug where 'Get a Lover' would abort if the character is chaste.
- Replaced the Pagan bonus buildings with culture buildings, so that foreign conquerors do not get the benefit of them.

1.01:
- CK2Plus now features full German localisation support.
- Contagious diseases are now rarer but more deadly.
- Changed scale of morale break threshold from 25-50% to 10-50% so martial skill is even more decisive.
- Added two new merc fleets, one in the black sea and the other near the holy land.
- Added five additional 500 man merc groups, non-hireable by the AI (located in: baltic, germany, balkans, egypt, arabia).
- Holy Wars will no longer result in gaining the target Duchy title, as it has proved impossible to fix the bugs and weird vassals gained from doing so.
- AI characters can now a pick a 'cooldown' ambition that is meant to reduce the frequency of murder plots occuring simply because they have nothing else to do.
- Added new ambitions: Convert a Province, Win a War, Gain Honorary Title, Adopt a Lifestyle, Gain a Kingdom and Become Emperor.
- Characters must now have at least 5 intrigue to start a plot.
- Religious conversion chance is now increased by having a large demesne.
- You must now be independent to grant a vassal independence.
- Granting independence to a De Jure vassal now costs 100 prestige, compared to 25 for releasing a not De Jure vassal.
- It no longer costs piety to imprison, exile or execute characters. While I think the piety costs make sense, it's rather strange that the actions are impossible to carry out if your piety is negative - why would low piety stop a cynical, depraved character from killing anyone?
- You can now declare war on characters that are either plotting to kill your close relatives or sheltering characters plotting to kill your close relatives in their realm. A victory will imprison all such plotters in your dungeon.
- Legitimizing Bastards is now done under Character Decisions.
- You can now declare Religious Defense on a ruler whose vassals are fighting some form of Holy War.
- Winning a Religious Defense war will now also end all variants of offensive Holy Wars their vassals are fighting against characters of your religion.
- The AI will no longer fight third-party claim wars where the claimaint would not end up as their vassal.
- The third-party claim war tooltip will now show you whether the claimaint will end up becoming your vassal after the peace or not.
- You can no longer declare third-party claim wars on a character that you already installed in a title via another third-party claim war. This is to prevent players from repeatedly invading the same County for prestige..
- Provinces with a revolt in progress should now show up as deep red on the revolt risk map.
- Gender succession laws can now only be changed one 'step' at a time (so you can't change from Agnatic to Cognatic or vice-versa, you have to first make it Agnatic-Cognatic).
- Revoking a title now always costs 100 prestige (to prevent a Muslim ruler from going completely nuts with revocations).
- Muslim rulers can now appoint up to 3 concubines from unmarried women in their court. Concubines will have legitimate children with their liege. If a concubine gets married or moves to a different court, she ceases to be a concubine.
- Muslim vassals can now plot to institute hereditary titles.
- Muslim rulers now have a new crown law category: Titles. This crown law determines whether titles can be freely revoked (without relation hits to other vassals), representing the Muslim system of appointed rather than hereditary rulers. Having the free revocation law in effect will make your vassals like you less, and they can still refuse and revolt when you try to revoke their titles. 
- Reworked the Award Honorary Title diplomatic action into a Character Decisions menu that contains both honorary titles and new character decisions.
- Added the 'Grant Independence' character decision that allows you to set a vassal free at the cost of a relations and prestige hit.
- Added the 'Revoke Honorary Title' character decision that allows you to revoke an honorary title. This will cause a relations hit unless the title you were revoking was that of Court Jester.
- Tweaked Papal name list to contain mostly names that were actually used during the CK2 era.
- Restored the Almoravid claims but made them an Emirate instead of a Sultanate in 1066, to give other Muslim rulers in the area a fighting chance.
- Split the Duchy of Marrakech into the Duchies of Marrakech and Ifni.
- Fixed some bugs with holy orders.
- Scaled Amass Wealth and Become Exalted Among Men ambitions to your title rank, to make them more feasible to achieve for a Count and more difficult to achieve for a King or Emperor.
- Reduced frequency of non immediate family (sibling or child) relatives asking you for titles.
- Relatives who are offended by your refusal to give them a title may now plot to force the issue.
- Relatives who ask for titles will now usually be offended if you deny them. If you have decent diplomacy you may be able avoid offending them.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing the AI from executing assassination plots.
- The AI will now abandon objectives after ten years of failing to fulfill them.
- Prestigious vassals can now plot to acquire their liege's primary title, even if they do not have a claim on it.
- Vassals can now plot against a liege that is not their top liege, making it more dangerous for a vassal lord to anger their own vassals.
- Fixed a bug with Arrange Courtier Marriages where it would spawn multiple women with the same name.
- Rebalanced the effects of levy laws. They will provide less minimum levies, but have less of an impact on relations as well.
- There are now five levels of each tax and levy law instead of four. This means that realms with an active crown law will always be able to have higher law settings than one completely without.
- Fixed a persistent bug where children would always be stillborn if their mother died in childbirth.
- Reduced the overall frequency of genetics traits when not inherited from parents (so you'll have less dwarven hunchback debutantes showing up at court).
- Decreased chance of inheriting Quick, Genius, Slow and Imbecile.
- Increased chance of inheriting Tall.
- Fabricating claims now has a fixed gold cost equal to the prestige cost. However, unlike prestige you do not need to have the gold on hand.
- Reduced the number of heavy cavalry gained from the German/Frankish culture buildings.

1.00:
- It is now possible to sail between the Nile Delta and the Gulf of Suez. This is necessary because otherwise the AI has issues with getting its troops stuck waiting for ships on the other side.
- Added decisions to form special titular Kingdoms for Muslims in Iberia.
- Reduced piety gain from handing titles to church, so that it is not possible to wage perpetual Holy War simply by handing out the temples you gain.
- A white peace in an independence war will no longer result in independence.
- Winning an independence war will now result in all other independence wars against the same target being automatically won. Ideally I would have liked to make independence war a war where you can call in other vassals who also become independent if you win, but this does not seem to be possible to do.
- Winning a war to replace your liege (by any of the various CBs) will now end any wars with the same general goal inconclusively.
- Winning a Religious Defense war will now end any offensive Crusade or Religious Wars the enemy is fighting against your religion. Any other Religious Defense wars your faith is waging against the same target will also end inconclusively.
- It is now possible to wage Holy War against distant enemies. Such a war is distinguished by a different name: Religious Invasion. A Religious Invasion costs 250 piety and cannot be declared if your piety is below 0.
- It now costs 100 piety to wage a Holy War on a neighbouring enemy. You cannot declare a Holy War if your piety is below 0. This is meant to represent Church/Temple approval of your war, and also to slow down the general pace of expansion.
- Changed the way invasions work. Instead of taking all occupied titles, you now get all titles the target character was holding which fall under the Kingdom you were invading. So if William wins the Norman Invasion, he takes the Kingdom of England and all English Counties, Duchies and Baronies Harold was holding.
- Pagans can now wage Holy Wars.
- Made the AI more reluctant to expand into Ethiopia.
- Axum is once again independent at game start.
- Added preferred terrain types for different unit/tactics. For instance, Pikemen will perform better in hills and mountains but poorly in forests, while light cavalry will do well in forests and deserts but poorly in mountains.
- Changed all battle tactic stats into standardized formulas.
- Linked battle morale break point with generals martial stat (flanks with no general will break at 50% morale, decreasing in increments to 25% break point at 20+ martial skill).
- Added mild defensive bonuses to most terrain types.
- Added the Have Fifteen Children and Have Twenty Children ambitions. Completing the Have Twenty Children ambition will give you a special nickname.
- Orthodox Priests can now marry.
- AI Barons will now get married instead of letting their dynasties die out.
- Feasts, Grand Hunts and Summer Fairs now cost a fixed amount of money depending on your title rank. Many of the events related to them have also been given fixed gold costs.
- Titular titles can no longer have Elective succession (as they have no valid electors).
- You now have a small chance of fabricating claims on a Duchy, even if your Chancellor has < 15 skill.
- Your chance of successfully fabricating a claim is now increased by having high prestige.
- Increased the prestige cost of fabricating claims to 200/500 for County/Duchy.
- Increased the wrong holding type penalty to -66%.
- Reduced the effects of ambitious and content to -30/+30 respectively.
- Added a decision to automatically arrange marriages for all eligible bachelors in your court. The characters will primarily marry women in your court, but if there is not enough women then random spouses will be generated for them. This decision is meant for people like me who like to have a large court but don't want to go through the tedious micromanagement of finding spouses for every male courtier. Close relatives of yours will not be affected by this decision, so you won't accidentally marry your son or daughter to a courtier.
- Switching out of Elective now requires High Crown Authority.
- Localisation should no longer be a mess in non-default language settings, though all the text from the mod will be in English.
- Tweaked province names, laws and borders in Poland.
- Integrated the 'Offer You Can't Refuse' mod that adds Sicilian cultural melting pots.
- Characters now have a 5% chance of gaining the culture of their province shortly after birth.
- Rulers can now 'go native', converting them and any children of theirs below the age of 16 to the culture of their capital province. Kings and Emperors are much less likely to go native. The chance to go native goes down with age. The player gets an option to avoid it happening to their character.
- Removed Warrior Cults. Instead, Pagans start with more regular troop buildings.
- East Africa, Sicily and Christian Iberia now start with more troop buildings.
- Removed the direct warscore bonus for holding contested settlements.
- Doubled the yearly warscore bonus for holding contested settlements.
- Tweaked it so that Barons can't convert the culture of a province. This should slow down rate of culture conversion.
- Reduced truce time for Ducal Claim wars to 6 years.
- Reduced truce time for County Claim wars to 3 years.
- The ruler of Mallorca in 1066 is now much more historical.
- Religious Head and Holy Order titles will now automatically convert characters holding them to their religion.
- Rebalanced province values in Russia and Scandinavia. Overall development potential of provinces was reduced.
- You will no longer have vassals declare independence wars without warning. Instead, vassal revolt risk and effects of regencies/civil wars were tweaked so that revolt chain reactions should happen on their own (see below).
- Added a decision to become King of Wends if you are Wend Pagan ruler that holds the Duchies of Brandenburg, Mecklenburg, Pommerania or Pomeralia either directly or through vassals.
- The AI will now make proper use of demesne laws.
- Tax laws are now tied to crown authority in the same way as Levy laws. Default tax laws are None for Feudal vassals and Minimum for Church and City vassals. This should put large Duchies at more of a disadvantage to proper Kingdoms.
- Added the county of Teate in Benevento to make the borders between Sicily and Lombardy more historical.
- Fixed some bugs related to heresies.
- You will no longer get tyranny from characters dying in your prison unless they died as a result of illnesses contracted from being in prison.
- Sick or injured prisoners will now ask for better accomondations, even if they were previously denied them. This is meant to give the player a second chance to avoid a tyranny hit if a prisoner falls ill.
- The dungeon and the oubliette no longer give direct health maluses, instead they make it much more likely to catch an illness.
- Rebalanced the Mongols to have fewer but larger stacks.
- Reduced the effects of dynastic prestige on marriages and newly born characters (having babies born with 500 prestige was getting silly).
- Winning a Holy War or Crusade will now result in taking the Duchy title the war was for, if the enemy is holding it. You still get all the holdings in the Duchy.
- Created an event will make the AI much smarter about handing out newly created Duchy titles, preferring to give them to Counts with their capital in the right area, or alternatively granting them along with a County to a Courtier, only granting a Duke title to an existing Duke if there are no better alternatives. This will only sometimes work on revoked/usurped titles, as the AI is sometimes too fast for my handout event to take effect.
- The Duchy of Tyrol is no longer divided by impassable mountains.
- Tweaked some weirdly shaped provinces.
- Tweaked Duchy borders in Algiers, and added the Duchy of Atlas.
- Added Ibiza as a County in the Duchy of Mallorca.
- Added the Kingdom of Azerbaijan as a de jure part of the Empire of Persia, composed of the Duchies of Tabriz, Azerbaijan and Derbent.
- Pommerania is now de jure a part of Germany.
- Salzburg is now a de jure part of Austria.
- Grisons is now a de jure part of Tyrol.
- Viviers is now a de jure part of Auvergne.
- Anhalt is now a de jure part of Brandenburg.
- Fejer is now a de jure part of Esztergom.
- Vendome is now a de jure part of Anjou.
- Damman and Basra are now de jure parts of Arabia.
- Jacwiez and Yatvagi are now de jure part of Lithuania.
- Rebellions will now rarely result in a large rebel army rising up. If the rebels take control of a province, the chance of bad rebel events (like burned buildings or killed province lords) increases, and the province may defect.
- Integrated 'culturally different cities' mod which gives different culture groups their own distinct city graphics.
- Rebalanced culture buildings so that different culture groups are roughly on part with each other.
- Cost of tech growth buildings is now consistent at 200 gold per 10% growth speed the building confers.
- Khazars now start with 2 provinces, and Itil was split into the Duchies of Itil and Saray so that nobody will have a ducal claim on them. This should give them a chance of surviving past the first five minutes of the game.
- Reduced the relations penalty for title claimaints.
- Stressed and Depressed are now mutually exclusive.
- When a character with the dishonorable trait dies, their heir will now get a 'dynastic stain' trait that confers diplomatic penalties equal to their predecessor's level of dishonorable, but which does not qualify you for excommunication or other ill effects of being dishonorable. If a character with dynastic stain is caught assassinating, the dynastic stain turns into a regular dishonorable trait at one level above what their dynastic stain level was at. Assuming you keep dynastic stain from being turned into dishonorable, it will not be transferred over to your heir. This change is meant to  add additional risk to inheritance-by-assassination, as you can now not simply wash away the consequenses by dying.
